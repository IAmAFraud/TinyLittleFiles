# Tiny Little Files
This is a game that was developed with a team of 5 during a class in my junior year. In this game, you play as Harry Dresden from the 'Dresden Files' series of books. This game is a bullet-hell, where the player has to use a combination of their trusty staff and handy revolver to defeat all of the enemys that are out to get him. With a miniboss and a final boss, this game has plenty of challenge to it.
